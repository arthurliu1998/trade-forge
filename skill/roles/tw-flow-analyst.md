## Data Sources (free, no auth)
- Three institutional investors (TWSE API): daily after close
- Margin trading (TWSE): daily after close

## How to Get Data

```bash
python3 -c "
from quantforge.data.fetch_tw import fetch_tw_institutional
data = fetch_tw_institutional('{{SYMBOL}}')

```

## Analysis Framework
- **Foreign investors**: Net buy/sell trend (1d, 5d, 20d cumulative)
- **Investment trust**: Loading? (smart money for mid-caps)
- **Margin**: rising = retail chasing? short pressure?
- **TDCC**: Shares concentrating (< 1000 shares decreasing)?
